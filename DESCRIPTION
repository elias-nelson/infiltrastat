Description: Provides statistical tools for analyzing experimental soil water
    infiltration data. The package implements modern, self-starting estimation
    procedures for common infiltration models including Horton, Philip,
    Green-Ampt, and Kostiakov. Functions are available for parameter estimation,
    goodness-of-fit evaluation, uncertainty analysis, and visualization of
    infiltration processes to support hydrological research, soil physics, and
    environmental modeling.
